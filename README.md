## What's this about? ##

I'm president of a social club for expats located in Bern, and in my spare time I thought I'd write a few simple tools to help make things easier on myself.


### Easy Recipes ###

We're not a cocktail bar, but I do like to get the shaker out when I'm working the bar and have a handful of drinks that I'll make for people.  The trouble is, I can't always keep the recipes straight (particularly at 11 pm on a Friday!).  It's a pain to flip through a book to locate one of the small number of recipes that I like to use, and printing out the recipes on paper is wasteful and annoying (the pages fall all over the place and always get splashed with something).  So why not make myself a tool that will keep the recipes I want at my fingertips?


### Price Finder ###

Amongst my other duties, I'm in charge of keeping the club supplied with beer, wine, and spirits.  As a non-profit organization, our prices are low -- and so are our margins (we're just looking to cover the cost of rent, really).  That means that I'm always on the lookout for the best deals, but with so many shops to choose from, it's hard for me to remember where the best prices are.
